Some of the features of Pharma Guide by Dahshan are:
 
- It covers the most important and relevant topics in pharmacology and therapeutics.
- It provides concise and comprehensive explanations of the mechanisms of action, pharmacological effects, indications, contraindications, precautions, interactions, and adverse effects of drugs.
- It includes clinical cases and questions that test the application of pharmacological knowledge and skills.
- It offers practical tips and advice on how to use drugs safely and effectively in different clinical scenarios.
- It reflects the current evidence-based practice and international guidelines on pharmacology and therapeutics.

Pharma Guide by Dahshan is suitable for students of pharmacy, medicine, dentistry, nursing, and allied health sciences. It is also a valuable reference for pharmacists, physicians, dentists, nurses, and other health care professionals who are involved in the rational use of drugs. The book is designed to help readers master the essential principles and concepts of pharmacology and to apply them in their daily practice.
 Here is what I created:  
The book is divided into four sections:

1. General Pharmacology: This section covers the basic principles and concepts of pharmacology, such as drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and drug development.
2. Systemic Pharmacology: This section covers the pharmacology of drugs that act on different organ systems and physiological functions, such as the autonomic nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal system, the endocrine system, the renal system, the reproductive system, the immune system, and the central nervous system.
3. Clinical Pharmacology: This section covers the pharmacology of drugs that are used in the treatment and prevention of various diseases and disorders, such as infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, gout, pain, fever, inflammation, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, insomnia, and substance abuse.
4. Special Topics: This section covers some special topics in pharmacology and therapeutics that are relevant to clinical practice and professional development. These topics include pharmacotherapy in special populations (such as children, elderly, pregnant and lactating women), pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology (the study of drug safety and effectiveness in real-world settings), pharmacoeconomics (the study of the costs and benefits of drug therapy), clinical trials (the design and conduct of studies that evaluate new drugs or interventions), evidence-based medicine (the use of the best available evidence to guide clinical decisions), and rational drug use (the appropriate selection and utilization of drugs for optimal outcomes).

Pharma Guide by Dahshan is a comprehensive and updated source of information on pharmacology and therapeutics that can help readers enhance their knowledge and skills in this important field. The book is written in a clear and simple language that makes it easy to understand and follow. The book is also organized in a logical and systematic manner that facilitates learning and revision.
